                I'm a self-taught aspiring computer programmer, passionate about learning and writing codes. I've always been fascinated about how writing some lines of code can make computer do amazing and complex things which makes our life pretty easier. And when you know whats really happening behind the scenes, whoa! it's just awesome. 
                Everyday, I try to learn something new, something cool and dive deep into the world of programming. There's a lot to learn but I'll keep sailing until I reach where I need to be-the ultimate goal.

                I'm a fun loving introverted person who loves music a lot (sometimes I try to play along with my guitar&#128517). I do like connecting with smart and interesting people, listen to them attentively, you know gain as much knowledge as I possibly could and apply them to communicate in a much better and professional way (Yeah, I'm still working on my communication skill&#128524). I love watching hollywood tv-series 'cause it helps me improving my fluency in English. Other hobbies include- playing sports, riding bike, working out, watching anime or reading some cool mangas out there&#128526.

                I'm looking forward to work and grow with an organisation where I can test and challenge my skills, work on real life projects, connect with smart-experienced people and learn from them during the process.
